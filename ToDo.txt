Core:
    Make new folder for core commands
    Prefix
    Add/remove channels from bot/admin bot/log categories
    Add/remove roles from permission levels
    Have a different file to show core version, put this in @ core command
Make addon packages/modules
    e.g. install core, then merge in logging module


Think about multi-server


Plans to make:
Create list of commands to reimplement
Create list of events to reimplement
    RAW going to be a problem?

 
Features to think about:
Look into remote terminal things
    Public ok? 
    Just put all logs on the server?
Figure out whether to use old database or start from scratch
Star-board/vote to pin
Mute list/command
	Have a "muted" flag in the DB, re-add on join
Adjustable rules - Save a "rules message" ID in the config, look it up (textchannel methods) and edit it
Command to add to the ToDo list
Feature request interface? 
Replacement stoner verification system (use PM's?)
Help request feature?
Ability to talk through bot? 
    Respond to mentions?
Math questions for Captcha?
Command to sweep through newbies and kick them if they've been a newbie for too long
	Exception for testdummy
    Make it timed somehow?
On new channel creation, add newbie perms so they can't see it
Limit @'s per amount of time
Afk command appends string to nickname
Cooldown on points
	Save timestamp of last scored message in SQL
	Check against it before adding score
	Update it only if score is added
Scoreboard command
/age command
Remove banned users from database? 
Logging. All of it. Thanks Dyno.

Re-add some of the temperature conversion stuff
Add date and time stuff

Things to do:
Actually learn how the SQL stuff works
