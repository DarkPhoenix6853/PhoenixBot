# RelicBot
Relic-tagging bot for Relic Burners

## Current Commands/features
Admin-level commands:
* CreateRelic
    * Adds a new relic/list of relics to the database (for if a new one is vaulted)
    * Only allows relics with an era (lith/meso/neo/axi), an optional space, a single letter, and then any amount of numbers. 
    * Doesn't break if no good relics are given
* DeleteRelic
    * Deletes a relic/list of relics and their associated user subscriptions from the database (for if someone screwed up and added a relic that they shouldn't have)
    * Can only delete relics that are already in the database
    * Doesn't break if told to delete a relic that doesn't exist
* RelicUsers
    * Shows a list of users that are subscribed to a relic/list of relics (Probably not very useful)
    * Doesn't ping anyone, just posts their names
    * Doesn't break if no relics are given/bad relics are given
* Kill
    * Shuts the bot down
    * Has to be restarted by the bot host (can't be done through Discord)
    * Only for if it somehow starts breaking in some way that hurts the server/users

User-level commands (Bot channel):
* AddRelic
    * Subscribes a user to a relic/list of relics so that people hosting it can ping them
    * Only adds relics that exist in the database that the user doesn't already have
    * Doesn't break if no good relics are provided
* RemoveRelic
    * Unsubscribes a user from a relic/list of relics
    * Doesn't break if asked to remove a relic that doesn't exist/the user doesn't have, just does nothing
* MyRelics
    * Shows a list of the relics a user is subscribed to
    * Formatted into tiers
* ListRelics
    * Shows a list of relics that can be subscribed to
    * Formatted into tiers
* Help
    * Provides a list of available commands, or shows a how-to for a specific command
* Squad
    * Lists people in a given squad
    * Doesn't ping anyone - just displays names
    * Lists full squads
    * Does not list closed squads
* MySquads - Lists the squads you are waiting on
    * Sections for "Subbed squads", "Hosted squads" and "Full squads" 

User-level commands (Recruiting channel):
* Create
    * Creates a hosting message, automatically detects vaulted relics and pings everyone subscribed to one of those relics
    * Pings everyone ONCE, even if they are subscribed to multiple relics in the list
    * Underlines relic names that are recognised
        * pings people for these relics, IF anyone is subscribed to that relic to begin with
        * (Temporary) if a role exists for that relic, also pings that
    * Creates squad identifiers for player counts (1/4, 2/4, 3/4)
* Join
    * Lets a user join squads
    * Can join multiple squads at once
    * If squad is filled, pings everyone in that squad
* Leave
    * Lets a user leave squads
    * Can leave multiple at once
    * Can use 'all' instead of a list of squad ID's
    * Only leaves squads that are still open (Closed squads cannot send notifications)
* Close (host only) 
    * Prevents more users from joining the squad, does not notify anyone
    * Can use 'all' instead of a list of squad ID's
    * Replaces squad player count with "X" in the host message
    * Cannot close full lobbies (These will no longer be open anyway)
* AddPlayer (host only)
    * Adds one to the number of players in the squad
        * Used if you find someone in Warframe's recruiting chat/have a friend join outside of the Discord server
    * If this will fill squad, require an extra -o argument (see help message)
* RemovePlayer (host only)
    * Removes one nameless player from the squad
    * NOT for kicking people out - just for removing people you've added with "AddPlayer"
    * Cannot go below the number of people who have used "join" + the host
* Kick (host only)
    * Kicks a user from a squad, or all squads hosted by the kicker
    * Nothing stopping them joining back in though

Dev-level commands (Unique to this server):
* ImportRelics
    * Imports all relics in "relics.json" into the database. Should only need to use this once ever unless you use the next one...
* PurgeDB
    * Wipes everything. Not meant to be used lightly. Probably requires you to use ImportRelics afterwards, unless you really like typing. 


All functions that detect the names of relics will work with any capitalisation/lack of spaces 
as long as the relics have an era (Lith/Meso etc.) followed by a single letter and then at least one (but maybe more) number/s

### Additional Features
* When a user leaves the server, their relic subscriptions are wiped to limit future useless pings

## Roadmap
### Project Noticeboard
* ~~Pull users from other squads~~
* ~~Close squads from joined users~~
* Changes for "recruiting squads" and "recruiting chat"
    * Have a notice at the top of recruitment saying how to join squads to replace the current reminder text
    * ~~Delete non-command messages immediately~~
### Project Search
* ~~New command to display all open squads that contain relics~~
    * ~~Either input a specific relic or leave blank for subbed squads~~

### Improvements to notice board
* Add some kind of override for people who want to add extra messages?
    * e.g. ++create -i Need someone else to host... (message as usual)
    * Would add some kind of info text to each squad, instead of splitting it off from them
    * Alternatively, any line beginning with -i becomes the info message for every squad below that (until another is reached)
* Possible improvements to parsing - see function in Create
### Project Escape
* Make sure people entering Discord formatting characters don't affect message formatting
    * In usernames e.g. \_person\_
    * In hosts e.g. \_\_Lith A1\_\_\_\_Lith A2\_\_
*  Investigate that one time the squad count was placed completely wrong because of weird emoji formatting
### Project Split
* Split into a second recruiting channel
    * Refactor recruit-channel checking into a library function
    * Store which channel a recruit message has been sent in
    * When editing, use this channel
    * Don't allow commands from recruit1 to join squads in recruit2
* Also opens up commands to be used in bot-spam
    * Not sure on Create or Join...
    * All Host-level commands would be fine
    * Leave would also be fine
    * Make sure to update ++help
### Project Emojis
* Reaction-based joining
    * On create, make enough reactions for squads (throw error if too many)
    * On reaction
        * search for a squad message with matching ID to see if we need to care
        * Use join/leave as appropriate for the reacting user
            * IGNORE HOST
### Project Cleanup
* Commands for admins to close all or any squad
* Timed closing
* Add a remake command - ++remake ID @players
    * Opens squad "ID"
    * uses the same text
    * fills it with players immediately
    * posts a new host message
    * only works if the old host uses it
        * Also only if the tagged players were in the squad?
    * Change "Squad" command to show original message
        * Make it work for closed squads
* Add a bump command
    * Only available if relic is getting close to timing out
    * (Notify a host if their squad is elligible)
    * Resets auto-delete timer
    * Pings relics again?
### Project Purge
* Inactivity sweeping
* Maybe use another bot, so it's safe in all channels? 
    * Have it do all the processing, but RelicBot actually handle the DB?
    * Check if concurrent DB access is safe - might just be able to use a second bot altogether
* Have a DB of the last time everyone sent a message
* Every night (sometime the server isn't as active) do a check
* If someone is getting close to being marked as inactive, warn them? 
* If someone is inactive, purge their relics from the DB (use code from someone leaving the server)
* Probably leave them a message of some kind reminding them which relics they had, or even a command they can use to get them all back
### Project Spaghetti
* Make a way to reload library functions
* Factor out functions for closing/filling/squad capacity editing
* Make library functions for logging, refactor out all those
* On error event, check for error type, tailor response
    * In most circumstances, save to .json
### Project Reputation
* Track number of filled squads someone has been a part of
* Some command to check someone's rep
* Leaderboard command
* Suggest that relic run order be changed for players with low rep (they go last to avoid scammers)

## Possible future features
### Small
* Merge back to its own repository - make a new one for PhoenixBot

### Medium

### Insane
* Mass ping using global list (Stops host messages from competing with each other)
    * automatically starts pinging when new users are added
    * new players to ping are just added to the list
    * New bot just for pinging?
        * Avoids competition
        * Alleviates rate limit
        * Use HTTP POST to communicate?
* Automatically make/delete a certain number of roles for most popular relics?
    * Less spam-pinging, requires X number of spare roles. Very far in the future. 
    * Only change roles if there is a significant imbalance
    * While new role is being populated, still mass-ping users instead of using it
